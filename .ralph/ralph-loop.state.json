Your goal is to improve forecasting.py and run the code repeatedly until the internal performance metric goes above 25% (0.25) and the graph generated by plot_submission.py makes sense. Workflow: run forecasting.py -> run plot_submission.py -> see the score from forecasting and the plot from plot_submission -> improve forecasting -> repeat. Output <promise>COMPLETE</promise> when the internal metric exceeds 0.25 and the plot is sensible.",
